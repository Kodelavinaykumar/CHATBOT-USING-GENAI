Project: Chatbot using Generative AI
Developed a conversational chatbot capable of generating human-like responses for general queries. The chatbot uses a pre-trained language model fine-tuned on a conversational dataset to enhance relevance and coherence in replies. Integrated the model with a React-based frontend for seamless user interaction, maintaining stateful conversations and logging sessions for analysis. Implemented context window management to handle multi-turn conversations and fallback handling for unknown queries. Focused on clean API design, user-friendly UI, and testing using various conversation scenarios to ensure consistent response quality.
